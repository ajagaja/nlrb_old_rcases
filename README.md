Results of NLRB union-representation elections, 1965-1998

This file was built from an old database of union elections maintained by the AFL-CIO in Washington, DC. It contains election results for all petitions filed with the NLRB between 1965 and 1998 that went to elections. That is to say, it does NOT contain data on organizing drives where petitions were filed but later withdrawn or dismissed.

The main file is in Stata's DTA format. The scripts document how the file was created from the raw data, which is too large to upload itself. I include it in case parties are interested.
